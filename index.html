              <h3>Story</h3>
              <p>
                The forest of Nibel is dying. After a powerful storm sets a
                series of devastating events in motion, an unlikely hero must
                journey to find his courage and confront a dark nemesis to save
                his home. Ori and the Blind Forest tells the tale of a young
                orphan destined for heroics, through a visually stunning
                action-platformer crafted by Moon Studios for Xbox One and PC.
                Featuring hand-painted artwork, meticulously animated character
                performance, and a fully orchestrated score, Ori and the Blind
                Forest explores a deeply emotional story about love and
                sacrifice, and the hope that exists in us all.

              <h3>Development</h3>
              <p>
                Ori and the Blind Forest was developed by Moon Studios, a
                worldwide collaboration of designers and programmers who have
                been working on the game for four years before it was released,
                with Microsoft acquiring the game about a year after development
                started. One of the lead team members is Thomas Mahler, an
                artist formerly working with Blizzard Entertainment. According
                to Microsoft producer Daniel Smith, Moon Studios is not located
                in any one location, but instead staffers are working from
                around the world, including Austria, Australia, Israel and the
                United States.Gameplay programmer David Clark described the team
                as being inspired by current and classic adventure games,
                notably the Rayman and Metroid franchises, and that Ori is
                intended as a "love letter" to those games.
